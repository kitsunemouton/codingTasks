# codingTasks: KMeans Task


## Description
This coding task aims to group countries using socio-economic and health factors to determine their development status. It utilises the K-Means clustering algorithm and references a dataset called 'Country-data', originally sourced from Help.NGO. This task is important for learning about clustering techniques and application to real-world scenarios.
